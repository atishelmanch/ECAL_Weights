# ECAL Weights Reconstruction

Working directory is src/. The purpose of this repository is to analyze and simulate ECAL data with the goal of reconstructing amplitude and obtaining precise and accurate energies.

ComputeWeights takes 10 samples and returns 10 weights. ParamReco is used to produce waveforms with A, t0, alpha and beta parameter values and reconstruct amplitude.
